## Workshop name

### Plan

> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)
It's very general club for people who like to read, and want a space to hang out with others who talk book, share book recs, and discuss books. People in the club could range from anyone who might pick up the occasional casual book or two...a year, or who can fervently curl up on their beds and read deep into the night, it's an open space for people to bond over books. Some activities include making book recommendations of varying genres(dystopian fiction, sci-fi, comics, etc). Late-night reading sessions, with old-fashioned flashlights:) Book-based discussion as we pick a book on day one and finish it over the course of the outernet. Making various program codes for ex book-rec generator. Mysterious swap book session, where for we toss in each of our books and randomly pick out a book to read for that day. We can even branch into a bit of writing exericse, writing telephone where we pass along a sheet of paper, with a person starting with a prompt, then passing the paper along to each of the members to each contribute a sentence.

> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)
Perhaps bookmarks with quote-inspired themes or coding-inspired aesthetics? Potentially 20 copies of Candy House but haven't decided yet, might need more opinion from the community on this one to use for our guild-wide discussion. I've never ran something like this, but I'm very excited and eager to meet other bookworm coders:))

#### Outline

For example:

1. Have people bring a book of their choosing(for book swap)
2. Coding Project - have people brainstorm list of 5 books they recommend, input it into program that helps generate book recommendations
4. Daily reading from our group-chosen book(for discussions later on)
5. Daily Fun activity(late-night reading, writing telephone, mysterious book swap, etc)

### Do you think you might need anything?

> Do you need hardware boards, or other supplies like paint that you would need us to purchase or have on hand? We won't have any projectors available.

I think we might need a blanket to sit on top of, some chairs, and beanbags(the ultimate lounge place for all book people), flashlights. But much of it is still in brainstorming phase!

### People involved

> List all the people who are running this workshop if it's more than 1!

For example:

* Prophet Orpheus
* Arav Narula
