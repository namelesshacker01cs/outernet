## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

* It will be mainly an info session for the Summer Courses 2023 for the initiative Magnolia Hacks
* I will start with the story/origin of Magnolia Hacks, how we started as two girls from a predominantly male math team at school, bonding over our shared interest for math+cs but more over our shared experience and vision to make our experience of exclusion into an opportunity of inclusion for others
* Our impact and past events Magnolia Hacks 2023
* Then I'm going to elaborate on current events our Board Member Recruitment and Summer Classe Series(July-August), which is recruiting for instructors and students 
* Website: https://magnoliahackhers.wixsite.com/magnoliahackhers
* For simplicity sake, can I send a document of links I want to show to the audience(ex: website, flyers, etc) to outernet staff beforehand to set it up?
* I will be using slides
